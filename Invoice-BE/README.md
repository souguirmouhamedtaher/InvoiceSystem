# Backend - invoiceApp

This project follows the principles of clean architecture to achieve a well-structured, maintainable, and testable codebase. The application is divided into four main layers:

1. **Domain Layer**
2. **Application Layer**
3. **Infrastructure Layer**
4. **Presentation Layer**

## Domain Layer

The domain layer contains the core business logic and domain entities of the application. It is independent of any external dependencies or frameworks.

### Components

- **Entities**: Represent the core domain objects and their behavior (e.g., `invoice`, `User`).
- **Domain Events**: Events that occur within the domain (e.g., `UserRegistered`, ``).
- **Aggregates**: Cluster roots that combine multiple entities and value objects into a single unit of consistency.
- **Domain Services**: Services that encapsulate domain logic and operations that don't belong to a specific entity or value object.
- **Repositories**: Interfaces that define the contract for persisting and retrieving entities from a data source.
- **Specifications**: Reusable rules or predicates that can be applied to entities or value objects.

## Application Layer

The application layer orchestrates the flow between the domain layer and the infrastructure layer. It handles use cases and application-level concerns.

### Components

- **Use Cases**: Classes that encapsulate the application's business logic and orchestrate the flow between the domain layer and the infrastructure layer.
- **Application Services**: Services that handle application-level concerns, such as transactions, security, or logging.
- **DTO (Data Transfer Object)**: Plain objects used for transferring data between layers, typically between the application layer and the presentation layer.

## Infrastructure Layer

The infrastructure layer handles external dependencies, such as databases, external services, and third-party libraries.

### Components

- **Persistence**: Repositories that implement the interfaces defined in the domain layer (e.g., database repositories, file repositories, remote API repositories).
- **External Services**: Classes that interact with external services or systems (e.g., email providers, payment gateways, third-party APIs).
- **Messaging**: Components for sending and receiving messages (e.g., message queues, event buses).
- **Caching**: Components for caching data (e.g., in-memory caches, distributed caches).
- **Configuration**: Components for managing application configuration (e.g., environment variables, configuration files).
- **Logging**: Components for logging application events and errors.
- **Migrations**: Scripts or classes for managing database schema changes or data migrations.

## Presentation Layer

The presentation layer handles HTTP requests and responses, and typically delegates work to the application layer.

### Components

- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses, and typically delegate work to the application layer.
- **Views**: Templates or components for rendering the user interface (if applicable).
- **Mappers**: Classes that map between DTOs and domain entities or vice versa.
- **Filters**: Classes that handle exceptions and error handling in the presentation layer.
- **Guards**: Classes that handle authentication and authorization in the presentation layer.
- **Interceptors**: Classes that intercept and modify requests or responses in the presentation layer.
- **Pipes**: Classes that handle data validation and transformation for incoming requests.

## Benefits of Clean Architecture

By following the principles of clean architecture, this project achieves several benefits:



- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility, promoting code organization and maintainability.
- **Testability**: The separation of layers and the use of interfaces facilitate unit testing and mockability.
- **Flexibility**: The infrastructure layer can be easily swapped out without affecting the core domain logic.
- **Scalability**: The architecture supports the growth and evolution of the application by keeping the core domain logic independent of external concerns.
